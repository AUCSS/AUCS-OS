# AUCS-OS
Following the book Linux From Scratch with the ultimate goal of creating our own distribution 

Read the first 2 chapters from Linux From Scratch: http://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/downloads/stable/ (Until 2.7. Mounting the New Partition ).<br>

We plan on meeting every Wednesday and working on what we learned from the chapters that we have read on our own time.
